=================================================================================           

exec-by-mail is a daemon which executes commands base on received e-mail messages.

The code is licensed under the GNU Public licence v.2+ (GPL).
(C) by Mikhail Fedotov 2015.



Installation
=================================================================================           

exec-by-mail is python script, so it needs just install it by:

make install

Configuration
=================================================================================           
Default configuration file is supplied in tarball and copied to /etc/exec-by-mail.conf.example
on installation.

By itself configuration file is python script, so you should be aware of it syntax.

It contans values for incoming/outcoming mail servers:

# Incoming mail server
_imapserver = 'imap.bla-bla.org'
_imaplogin  = 'logmein@bla-bla.org'
_imappass   = 'mypass'

# Outgoing mail server
_smtpserver = 'smtp.bla-bla.org'
_smtplogin  = 'logmein@bla-bla.org'
_smtppass   = 'mypass'


Some additional parameters:

_timeout  = 30
_pidfile  = '/var/run/exec-by-mail.pid'


Most valueable part, execution control list:

_config = [
  ["PING", 
   ["",      "",        "Body", "PONG %f"],
  ],
  ["DISKSTAT", 
   ["",     "df -kl",   "Body", "Statistics"],
  ],
  ["FILE", 
    ["DIR", "ls -1 %1", "Body", "Directory %1"],
    ["GET", "%1",       "File", "File %1"]
  ]
]

So, "_config" execution control list contains of command definitions. 

Each command definition consist of name and list of subcommands.

Each subcommand consist of four elenements:
 - subcommand name (can be "" in the case of single subcommand)
 - command to execute (can be empty, in some cases can be interpreted as file name, see below)
 - replay parameter:
   B|Body       - send command output as body of message
   A|Attachment - send command output as attachment to the message
   F|File       - interpret command field as file name, and send that file as attachment to the message
   N|No         - do not send reply message, just execute command
 - Some text which will be prepended to the replay message body.

Command can contain parameters. 
These parameters will be substituted instead of %1-%9 before execution. 
Value of 'From' headers of incoming message will be substituted instead of %f


Allow/deny lists

_allow = [
  "bla-bla-allowed@mail.com", 
  "@gmail.com", 
]

_deny = [
  "@yahoo.com"
  "bla-bla-denyed@yahoo.com"
]

It is possible to specify allow/deny pattern by exact e-mail address or whohe e-mail domain.
If _allow pattern specified and non-empty then e-mails only from matched senders will be processed.
If _allow pattern is absent or empty it does not taken into account.
If _deny pattern specified and non-empty then e-mails from matched senders will be discarded.



Usage
=================================================================================    
  
To trigger some command it needs to send message to mail recepient specified by _imaplogin
parameter (logmein@bla-bla.org). Message body should contains list of command, one command per line.

For example, according the execution control list above, message with text:

PING

will results in replay message string "PONG <sender e-mail>" inside, message with text:

FILE GET /etc/passwd

will results in replay message which will contains /etc/passwd file in attachment.

Reply address is determined by 'Reply-To' or 'From' headers of incoming message.
   

Security
=================================================================================           
This service is potentially vulnerable. Please use it at your own risk !

It is suggested:
 - use allow/deny lists
 - do not use vulnerable commands in execution control list.
